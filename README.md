## dark matter
inspired by [google's material color pallete](https://www.google.com/design/spec/style/color.html)

there are other vim themes based on them but none that I like.  
this is very much work in progress, I haven't done the colors for gui version for example.

## installation
to try out use your favourite plugin manager

`Plug 'nicknikolov/dark-matter.vim`  
and run `:PlugInstall`

and don't forget to add the iTerm color scheme!

## todo
1. gui
2. provide schemes for other terminals
3. probably other stuff
